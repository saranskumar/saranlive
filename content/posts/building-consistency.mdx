# The Trap of Complexity

When I first started building web applications, I was obsessed with "flash". 
If it didn't move, spin, or fade in, it wasn't finished.

But as I've grown as an engineer, I've realized that **reliability** and **maintainability** are the true markers of quality.

## Moving to Typescript & Systems

For this portfolio, I made a conscious decision to strip away the noise.
No massive particle libraries. No heavy 3D canvases that drain your battery.

Instead, I focused on:
*   A robust **MDX** pipeline for writing thoughts (like this one).
*   A strict **Design System** using Tailwind and Shadcn/UI.
*   **Accessibility** as a first-class citizen, not an afterthought.

## The Stack

I chose Next.js (App Router) because it enforces a mental model of server vs. client. 
This separation is crucial for keeping interactions snappy while ensuring content is SEO-friendly.

It's not about being boring. It's about being effective.
