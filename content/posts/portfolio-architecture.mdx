# Introduction

Building a portfolio is often seen as a design challenge. "Make it look good," they say. But as an engineer, I see it differently.

## The Problem

Most portfolios are static brochures. They tell you *what* someone did, but not *how* they think.

## The Solution

I wanted to build a system that reflects my engineering values:
1. **Calmness**: No unnecessary noise.
2. **Depth**: Click to explore, don't just scroll.
3. **Performance**: It should feel instant.

This site is the result of that thinking.
