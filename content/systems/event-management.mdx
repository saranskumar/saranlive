## Problem

IEEE Travancore Hub Meet 2025 expected 500+ attendees across multiple event tracks. The existing process relied on Google Forms + manual spreadsheet verification — slow, error-prone, and not scalable. We needed a purpose-built system that handled registration, ticket generation, gate check-in, and real-time headcount — all before event day.

## Architecture

```
[Registration Form] → [Firebase Firestore]
                              ↓
                    [QR Code Generator]
                              ↓
                    [Email Delivery (mailto)]
                              ↓
                    [Gate Check-in App] → [Firebase update]
                              ↓
                    [Admin Dashboard (real-time)]
```

Three distinct UIs: a public registration page, a gate-check-in scanner (mobile PWA), and an admin dashboard.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Frontend | Next.js 14 App Router, TypeScript |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |
| Database | Firebase Firestore (real-time) |
| Auth | Firebase Auth (admin panel) |
| QR | `qrcode` npm library |
| Hosting | Vercel |

## Implementation

Registration data was written to Firestore with a unique `ticketId` (UUID v4). A server action generated a QR code PNG encoding the `ticketId` and returned it to the confirmation page.

At the gate, a mobile check-in app (camera + `html5-qrcode`) scanned tickets, queried Firestore for the `ticketId`, and toggled `checkedIn: true`. Duplicate scans were blocked by checking the flag before updating — preventing tailgating.

The admin dashboard used Firestore's `onSnapshot` listener to reflect headcount in real-time with no polling.

## Outcome

- **500+ registrations** processed with zero data-loss
- **Sub-2 second check-in time** per attendee per gate
- **Zero duplicate entries** through UUID + flag guard
- Real-time admin view eliminated the need for manual radio communication at gates

## Lessons Learned

- **Firestore real-time listeners** are excellent for event dashboards but need careful index planning to avoid composite query costs.
- **Offline resilience** matters: the check-in app needed local caching (IndexedDB) as the venue WiFi was unreliable.
- **UX under pressure** is different from dev UX — gates needed very large touch targets and instant visual feedback.
