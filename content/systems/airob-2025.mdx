## Problem

Design and build an autonomous robot capable of completing a structured obstacle course under strict time constraints. The challenge required precise motor control, reliable obstacle detection, and a robust decision-making loop — all on a constrained microcontroller without an OS.

## Architecture

The system was split into three subsystems:

1. **Perception Layer** — An ultrasonic array (front, left, right) combined with an IR line sensor array for surface tracking.
2. **Decision Layer** — A finite state machine (FSM) running on the main loop, consuming sensor data to decide: FORWARD, TURN_LEFT, TURN_RIGHT, STOP.
3. **Actuation Layer** — L298N dual H-bridge driving two DC motors with PWM speed control via Arduino's `analogWrite`.

## Tech Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Microcontroller | Arduino Mega 2560 |
| Language | C++ (Arduino framework) |
| Distance sensing | HC-SR04 Ultrasonic × 3 |
| Line sensing | 8-channel IR array |
| Motor control | L298N H-Bridge |
| Power | 3S LiPo 11.1V |

## Implementation

The FSM had five states: `IDLE`, `NAVIGATE`, `WALL_AVOID`, `LINE_FOLLOW`, `STOP`. Transitions were triggered by sensor thresholds — e.g., if `frontDist < 15cm`, transition from `NAVIGATE` to `WALL_AVOID`.

The key challenge was sensor noise. Ultrasonic sensors have interference at close range; this was solved with a rolling median filter over 5 readings per cycle, reducing false triggers by ~80%.

Motor calibration was handled with a trim constant stored in `EEPROM`, allowing field adjustments without reflashing.

## Outcome

The robot completed all course stages successfully in the fastest recorded time of the competition, securing **1st place** at AIROB 2025, All Kerala Robotics Competition.

## Lessons Learned

- **Hardware-software co-design** matters. Sensor placement relative to chassis geometry directly affects FSM threshold values.
- **Noise is your biggest enemy** in embedded systems. Invest in filtering early.
- **EEPROM-backed configuration** is a simple but powerful field-debugging tool.
